# Type Design Course

- Instructor: [Lynne Yun](lynneyun.com)
- Parsons School of Design, Art Media & Technology
- 4:00–6:40pm on Thursdays, Spring 2020

## Course Description

Knowing how to design letterform systems is a unique and specialized skill. It requires keen eyes that are attuned to see the finest of details, yet also know how to predict how those small features will function when they are seen repeatedly throughout a typographical system. In this course, students will learn the nuts and bolts of designing a working typeface. They will start out with calligraphy exercises to help understand the modular nature of typefaces, then apply that knowledge as a foundation for an original digital typeface. 

### Learning Outcomes:
By the successful completion of this course, students will have:

- Have knowledge of historical overview of letterforms
- Understand the modular nature of latin letterform systems
- Articulate and analyze letters and compositions
- Knowledge of how to plot proper bezier vector points
- Designing a working digital typeface (minimum ASCII set)
- Fluency in industry standard software (Glyphs)
- Know resources to seek inspiration & self-improvement (online & in NYC)

### Required Supplies:
- Pencil and sharpener
- Eraser
- Ruler
- Masking or artists’ tape
- Pad of 9” x 12” Layout bond or tracing paper
- Black Zig Memory System Calligraphy Markers
- A range of sizes of black markers (.05 micron to fine sharpie)
- Mac with Glyphs app installed
